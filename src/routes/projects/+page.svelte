<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>I always tend to delete my projects. These ones I won't delete that fast:</p>

<div class="grid">
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>It's this website. It's gone through many iterations.</p>
	</div>
	<a href="/projects/gitlab" class="card clickable">
		<h2>Tanuki for GitLab</h2>
		<p>It's GitLab. On your phone.</p>
	</a>
</div>

<style>
	a.card {
		text-decoration: none;
	}
</style>
