# Another CSS framework

I just made a CSS (style) framework again.

## Why?

I don't really like using classes to style my websites. I don't like creating components for every single thing I use.

It's easily themable and **replaceable**.

Using a good looking and automatically adapting button, just use `<button>`. No need to create a component in your (but nobody else's) favourite JS framework, so all the buttons have to same Tailwind classes.

## Why not?

This doesn't scale as good as many others. If you want to create a corporate-level dashboard for your entire company, stick to sth like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). But for you're little side-hussle projects, you should be good to go!

## Wanna see it?

## Wanna use it?

Just add

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felix-schindler/easy-style/v0.1.0/easy-style.min.css">
```

to your `.html` file. That's it.
