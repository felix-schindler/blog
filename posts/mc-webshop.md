title: Making a web shop for Minecraft

I've made a web shop so you can trade items with players online. It's **free**
and **open-source** at [`gitlab.com/mc-webshop`](https://gitlab.com/mc-webshop).
(At the time of publishing the API isn't publicly available _yet_.)

# Why

My favorite Minecraft Server back in the day (2013) was Freecraft, more
precisely their skyblock server `sky.freecraft.eu`.

Even back then [they had a web shop](http://sky.webshop.freecraft.eu) where you
could trade items for ingame money ðŸ’µ with other players.
