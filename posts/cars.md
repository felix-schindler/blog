I've just seen a YouTube video titled
"[To see Germany’s future, look at its cars](https://youtu.be/A4OmtyaBHFE)". As
I found it quite interesing, I'd like to say a few things about it.

# Nice cars coming fresh out of Germany

I'm a huge fan of the fuell cell. While Elon Musk might be against it, I think
its pros overweight its cons in many ways. The most exiting fuel cell car
available for sale today is made by the german manufacturer "Gumpert
Automobile".

Car makers are mostly playing catch-up.

# All things ✨DigItAl✨

Like [George Hotz](https://geohot.github.io/blog/), I think most probems these
days are software and _not_ hardware problems. Therefore, building a good car is
nice, but building one that drives itself is better.

I often feel like people just don't like digital things.

Starting with schools and ending with companies

Germany is missing out on digital innovation.

# USA, Germany, China
