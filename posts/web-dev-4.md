## What are HTTP Methods?

There are only a few common HTTP methods. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and
`DELETE`. You can do everything with just `GET` and `POST`, but it's nice
sticking to the current standard.

### What are the differences?

The HTTP methods translate to the following actions

```
GET - Read something
POST - Create something
 -
```
